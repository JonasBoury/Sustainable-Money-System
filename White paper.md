The model has been renamed from 'Circular Money economic ecosystem' to 'Sustainable Money System'. We are still in the process of updating all documentation so references to the old name can still be found.

# Abstract
This paper proposes a theoretical monetary model, named Sustainable Money Systems or SuMSy, with the assumed capacity to change the shape of the economic ecosystem in such a way that it puts the wellbeing of people and the planet at its core. For that we have leveraged new ways to bring money into and take money out of circulation and have implemented mechanisms that drive sustainable behavior.

## 1 Bringing money into circulation
At the heart of SuMSy is a virtual and infinite pool of available money. Money from this pool can be brought into circulation for specific goals: to provide for a guaranteed income for everyone and to fund projects for the common good.

### 1.1 Guaranteed income
With SuMSy everyone receives a guaranteed income. The money needed for paying this guaranteed income is brought into circulation as needed. The guaranteed income should be high enough to be able to lead a decent life.
We acknowledge that the exact amount of this guaranteed income can not be set in stone and must be changeable in the future to adapt to real living costs. The decision for this must be made in such a way that it is ensured that everyone can lead a decent life within the constraints of available resources of the planet. A couple of options to achieve this are presented.
				
### 1.2 Projects for the common good
The money to finance education, healthcare, public transport, … is partly paid for by demurrage fees and taxes and partly brought into circulation as needed. These monetary streams must be completely transparent in order to avoid corruption. We propose that the decision of which projects get the label 'project for the common good', and the accompanying ability to bring extra money into circulation, should be co-decided by the population, thereby giving them governance powers and increasing their stake in society.

## 2 Taking money out of circulation
Since constantly adding money to the economy leads to out of hand inflation, there also needs to be a mechanism that takes money out of circulation. When a balance is reached between bringing money into circulation and taking money out of circulation the total mass of money stabilises, thereby creating a stable pricing scheme if the velocity of money remains stable too.

### 2.1 Demurrage fee
A demurrage fee is a fee that is payed for holding on to capital. This is a percentage of the money held in accounts and is collected right before guaranteed income is added to someone’s account. This money is then first redirected to projects for the common good. The person paying the demurrage fee has the choice to assign it to one or more preferred projects. Surplus money from overfunded projects is taken out of circulation. Projects that are underfunded can bring money into circulation up the required budget.
In order to give people the capability to also save some money and to not create a spending spree, everyone is given a cost free savings allowance. As long as someone holds less than their cost free savings allowance, no demurrage fee is collected. The cost free savings allowance can be spread over multiple accounts and even be lent to someone else. The ownership of the cost free savings limit remains with the person who lent it out to a third party and can therefor be taken back at any time.

### 2.2 Taxes
Taxes are collected from activities that work against the well being of people and planet. Examples of these are pollution, producing non recyclable goods, destruction of natural resources, … The money collected from these taxes is redirected to projects for the common good, just like the demurrage fee. Here too the person, people or organisation paying the taxes can redirect that money to preferred projects.

## 3. The objectives
The goal is not only to create an alternative economic ecosystem which better supports the wellbeing of people and planet but also to create a shift in power balance. The latter is achieved because the decision power to bring money into circulation is distributed in our model. And since history has shown that those who hold the power to bring money into circulation also obtain a lot of power on a political level, our model shifts this power from the centralised model that exists today to a distributed model.
It is our assumption that by doing so we would raise the sense of ownership and consequentially accountability in the general population.

**About the author**

Stef Kuypers has a history in IT, creative thinking, improvisation and business interventions. He self studied on economics, monetary systems, complexity theory and sociology through reading online research articles on the subjects and engaging with progressive thinkers. He got interested in monetary systems after discovering that the biggest hurdle to solving our climate change problem is actually our monetary system. Because of this he started wondering whether we could create a monetary system which would create more sustainable economical and social behaviour and support the wellbeing of all people. That kind of thinking eventually led to the creation of the Sustainable Money System.


# Circular Money economic ecosystem (CMee) - a design for the future

## 1. Introduction
SuMSy is a theoretical model for an alternative economic ecosystem. We acknowledge that this model has not yet been tested in real life situations and that all the claims which are made in relationship to SuMSy are assumptions until further research has been carried out. The assumptions which are made are extrapolated from related and peer reviewed research and research based literature.

**The core claims we make are the following:**
The way in which money is brought into and taken out of circulation has an influence on the behaviour of the people using it and it nudges them in predictable ways.
Built in mechanics can help further nudge people towards predictable behaviour. It is our responsibility that these nudges serve the common good.
Implementing SuMSy would install a form of ‘governance by incentive’ and would require less rules and regulations to keep excesses in check.
It would cause a rise in the wellbeing of both people and planet while at the same time creating a stable, sustainable economy.

The model has been inspired by both [the story of Wörgl][3] in Austria in the early 1930’s and by the basic income movement and the various experiments that have been done with it. Both the initiative in Wörgl and the experiments with a basic income had positive impacts on the communities they were active in.

**The challenges SuMSy aims to tackle are the following:**
* Build a stable economic system that is not prone to fail due to economic slowdown.
* Ensure basic qualitative social services such as education, healthcare, environmental care, …
* Make sustainable business models more economically attractive.
* Liberate intellectual and other potential from purely profit oriented activities to enlist it for value oriented activities.
* Move towards a more collaborative economy.
* Diminish income gaps and eradicate poverty.
* Free up mental bandwidth for everyone to create time for reflection on life, building meaningful relationships with others and pursue meaningful objectives.

## 2. Motivation
The idea emerged after looking into the reasons why it seemed to be so hard to solve our climate change problem although we knew what to do and how to do it. The search eventually led to the current monetary system being the main blocker and cause due to the incentives it creates for acquiring large sums of money. This is because, once enough money has been gathered, it will almost automatically attract more money without actually adding real value to society. More often than not this profit seeking behaviour creates a disregard for environmental and human costs.

On July 15, 2016 the Guardian published an [article by Jason Hickel][20] which states that in order to combat climate change we don’t just need to switch to renewable energy, we need to create a new economic system. Creating that new economic system is what this proposition is all about.
Let’s first have a look at where the flaws in our current system lie.

### 2.1 Capitalism, an economy of acquisition
Our current capitalistic economic system is one of acquisition. Its goal is to acquire capital in its many forms. Real estate, factories, patents, web companies, … and ultimately the one to rule them all: money. And all these assets are perceived to be scarce. If you want something you can’t allow someone else to have it too because there is not enough for the both of you. This creates unhealthy competition and a world where the ‘get as much profit as possible’ business model is king. If you don’t make more profit every year your business will be branded as a failure. Grow, grow, grow! is the mantra of the day.
This mentality is costing lives, literally! Real, life saving projects like the one that wants to create cheap, [paper based blood test devices to be used in developing countries][21] get left in the dust because they are not profitable enough.
In a world where perceived scarcity runs the show and it’s all about collecting as much as possible, greed is the only outcome. And we all know how that pans out. It’s a destructive force that eats away at our naturally helpful nature. It even has [a measurable effect on 3 year olds][22].
But it doesn’t have to be this way. We created the current economic system, which means we can also change it.

### 2.2 The components of an economic system
An economic system, at its core, consists of goods and services that are traded. Usually, to facilitate that trade, a monetary system is used.
Economists will say this is oversimplification and they’re right, if we want to talk about the full complexity of economic systems. But take away goods and services and there won’t be much of an economy left. The complexities of the economic system arise from the wants and needs that are associated with these goods and services, and the design of the monetary system, if one is used.
An economy runs in a society. People are needed in order to have economic activity, even if those people use computers and robots to perform that activity for them (think smart trading algorithms on Wall Street). Since it ultimately comes down to running a well functioning society through economic and other activities, it suffices to look at which economic activity is needed in order to have this well functioning society. In other words, which goods and services need to be passed around (traded) in order to keep everyone happy?
The primary goods are clean water, food and shelter. Without water or food people would just die, without shelter life can get very harsh, depending on where they live.
There is currently no real shortage of either of these resources, yet people starve from hunger, die from a lack of clean water and then the countless homeless people who are sleeping on the streets all over the world are not even mentioned. Why? The answer is simple. Because those people don’t have enough access to money. If they had, it would open the doors to clean water, nutritious food and decent shelter. Neo liberalists claim these people just don’t work hard enough and if they would they’d be lifted out of poverty in no time. Nick Hanauer states it differently in his [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fellow_plutocrats_the_pitchforks_are_coming): luck is a major factor in your success.
And the money? That’s just an agreement on what is used to represent real value.

### 2.3 The non-flow of our current system
The one big problem capitalism has is that it inherently makes money flow from the poor to the rich. This [shows in the figures][25]:

* In 2010, 388 people owned as much money as the 3.4 billion poorest.
* In 2016 that number changed to 8 people holding the same amount of wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest.

Money just has a strong tendency to flow to the financial world. Once it gets there it just runs around in circles, adding no real value to society. But it does increase the wealth of the wealthy. The entire financial world is actually a huge pile of money just sitting there, doing nothing but shifting place from one pocket to the next. Sure, a little bit trickles down to the rest of society again. But obviously not as much as is being sucked into it. Otherwise it would be hard to explain [the distribution of money in our world today][26]. Here’s a small excerpt of those numbers:

* $28.6 trillion: readily available money (CC, banknotes and money on accessible accounts)
* $70 trillion: value of the stock market
* $600 — $1200 trillion: value of the derivatives market

If trickle down economics would really be a boon for society, these numbers should be more in balance.
Why is this? The answer is fairly simple: hoarding money is rewarded with more money. Yes, this is a simplified statement but once you get your hands on your first couple of millions it becomes ever easier to increase that amount if you play the financial markets right. And when you have enough to spare you can spread your risks and make sure that there’s no real danger to losing it all.
Neo liberals argue that these people invest in businesses. Yes, they do … if they can turn a profit from them. More often than not, a successful startup eventually turns into a money machine for just a few people. Take Uber for example. Who is getting rich from the Uber business model? The drivers or the people at the top? Again, most of the money flows to … pools of money. This is a mostly one directional flow, which is bad news if you’re on the wrong end of it.

**Figure 1 - Monetary flows in capitalism**

Debtors and bank employees are also account holders but are displayed as separate entities to keep things clear.
The ‘real’ economy is the market of product and service providers which are not related to the financial market. Every member of this ‘real’ economy is also an account holder.
The money a debtor receives on her account is created by the bank, from debt with an interest. When the debt is payed back, this money is destroyed again together with the debt. The interest is profit for the bank. For a debtor, the income flow must be higher than the spending flow if they want to be able to pay back the loan. That surplus on the income flow is at least partly used to pay for the interest on the loan and the bank costs. This process extracts money from the ‘real’ economy. 

An account holder must make sure that the sum of their income, interest on their account and their profits and dividends are at least as high as their spending. Or become a debtor. If the income is high enough they can save some money for later. Once the sum that is saved reaches a certain volume the likelihood that it will be invested in the financial market rises due to the low to non existent interest that is gained on bank accounts these days. If interests were high, the money would just be kept in the bank, which also results of it ending up in the financial markets (see below). Once this happens most of the profits and dividends have a high likelihood to be reinvested in financial products, thereby keeping money in the financial markets. Also note that, if the income is largely received through the ‘real’ economy, part of that money now flows through to the financial markets.
Interests on loans, and profits and dividends from financial investments received by the bank which are not spent on wages and operating costs are also mainly reinvested in the financial markets. Banks also use a large part of their managed deposits for this purpose. This is possible because banks are not obligated to keep the total sum of all money on the accounts they manage, available as reserve. This means that a lot of the money that people think is on their bank account is actually running around in the financial market.
As can be seen, unless money is forced out of the financial markets, it has a strong tendency to flow towards this financial market where most of it remains. This impoverishes the ‘real’ economy.

### 2.3 Conclusion
The model presented here is simplified but captures the core flows of the current monetary system. It’s easy to see how the flows depicted by the orange arrows all contribute to helping money reach the financial markets. Once it reaches those, it tends to stay there. One could conclude that the financial markets are a dead end for monetary flows.
It is clear that the current driving forces of our economic system have destructive effects on society at large. It’s this observation that has lead to the design of CMee so that a new, more stable and fairer economic ecosystem can emerge. One where real flow of money is achieved, without dead ends.

## 3. CMee
CMee is an alternative monetary system with the following characteristics:
Money is brought into circulation without debt.
There are two ways to bring money into circulation:
To pay for a guaranteed income.
To fund projects for the common good.
A demurrage fee is charged as an incentive to keep money flowing and as a disincentive to extreme hoarding.
Money is taken out of circulation when a project for the common good is overfunded.

**Figure 2 - Monetary flow in CMee**

### 3.2 Core structure
This section describes the technical components of CMee.
1 Circular Coin or CC in CMee is the equivalent of 1 coin in the current monetary system. In the US 1 CC = 1$, in Europe 1 CC = 1€, …

#### 3.2.1 Central money pool
The central money pool is a virtual and infinite pool of money. Money can be taken out of this pool to be brought into circulation and can be returned to this pool when it is taken out of circulation.

#### 3.2.2 Digital identity
Every person is linked to exactly one digital identity in CMee. This identity is used to link that person to everything else in CMee.

#### 3.2.3 Accounts
Everyone starts with one account, which is linked to their digital identity. Everyone can create as many additional accounts as they want. Accounts can also be shared with others. This happens by linking them to their digital identities. That way an account is always linked to 1 or more digital identities. People whose digital identities are linked to an account are custodians of that account. 

#### 3.2.4 Cost free savings limit
CMee is a monetary system without interest on accounts. There is however a cost to holding on to money. The cost free savings limit is the amount for which people do not have to pay in order to hold on to money. Above this limit it costs something to hold on to money. The cost free savings limit is tied to the digital identity and is the same for everyone. That person to whom the digital identity belongs is free to spread this cost free savings limit across as many accounts as they want, even shared ones. The cost is then calculated separately for each account.
By default, the entire cost free savings limit is attributed to the first account that is linked to the digital identity.

#### 3.2.5 Bringing money into circulation
Money is brought into circulation through 2 means:
A guaranteed income. The guaranteed income is linked to the digital identity and is the same for everyone on a yearly basis. The person to whom the digital identity belongs can allocate this guaranteed income to the accounts their digital identity is linked to. By default the entire guaranteed income is linked to the first account that is linked to the digital identity. The guaranteed income is deposited periodically on the linked accounts according to the spread chosen by the owner of the digital identity. The period can be monthly, weekly or even daily and does not have to be the same for everyone. The guaranteed income is deposited right after the demurrage fee (see below) is subtracted from the account(s).
Projects for the common good. Projects for the common good are projects that are indispensable for or support a well functioning society which ensures the wellbeing of people and planet.  These include but are not limited to education, healthcare, environmental preservation, … Not all funding for projects for the common good needs to be brought into circulation out of the central money pool though. They are also funded through demurrage fees and taxes. See below.

#### 3.2.6 Demurrage
As mentioned before, holding on to money above the cost free savings limit is not free in CMee. When an account’s balance rises above the cost free savings limit allocated to it, a demurrage fee is charged on the amount above this cost free savings amount. The demurrage fee is a percentage of that amount. It is collected just before the guaranteed income is brought into circulation and deposited on the personal accounts. It is calculated as follows:
The weighted average of the account is calculated. This is done by looking at the balance over the period since the last guaranteed income has been deposited and assigning a weight to each balance which is equal to the time that balance remained unchanged. The weighted balance is then: Sum(balance1 * weight1, …, balanceN * weightN) / total weight. From this weighted average the demurrage fee is calculated.

For example: Let’s assume everyone has a cost free savings limit of 25000 CC. For simplicity, we use a day as the time unit (in reality we would use a micro or even a nanosecond as the time unit) and the period over which the demurrage fee is calculated is 30 days. Let’s take someone who has allocated the full 25000 CC cost free savings limit to their personal account and they have 27000 CC on it initially. A sample of transactions could look like this:

| Day | Transaction | Balance | Demurrage affected amount |
|-----|------------:|--------:|--------------------------:|
| 1   |             |   27000 |                      2000 |
| 3   |        +300 |   27300 |                      2300 |
| 7   |       -5000 |   22300 |                         0 |
| 15  |       +2000 |   24300 |                         0 |
| 19  |       +4500 |   28800 |                      3800 |
| 20  |       -3000 |   25800 |                       800 |
| 22  |        -200 |   25600 |                       600 |
| 29  |        -700 |   24900 |                         0 |

The weights for each balance would then be:

| Demurrage affected amount | Weight = days in account | Amount * Weight |
|--------------------------:|-------------------------:|----------------:|
|                      2000 |                        2 |            4000 |
|                      2300 |                        4 |            9200 |
|                      3800 |                        1 |            3800 |
|                       800 |                        2 |            1600 |
|                       600 |                        7 |            4200 |

The weighted average amount that is affected by the demurrage fee then becomes:
(4000 + 9200 + 3800 + 1600 + 4200) / 30 = 760
With a demurrage fee of 2%, the amount of money that is taken out of the account is 15.2 CC.

The collected money is used to fund the projects for the common good. Everyone who pays demurrage fees can appoint preferred projects to which their demurrage fees are allotted to. We believe this would lower resistance to paying the demurrage fee and create a sense of ownership towards the projects the money is assigned to. We also believe it adds to the sense that people contribute to something larger than themselves, which plays a key role in mental wellbeing.
Using the demurrage fee this way has an immediate effect on the amount of money that needs to be brought into circulation for these projects. It could be seen as a form of recycling the money collected from the demurrage fee.

We propose a tiered demurrage fee system, similar to the tiered tax systems on labour.

#### 3.2.7 Taxes
In Cmee taxes are no longer a necessity in order to fund governance activities when all governance activities have the goal to serve the common good. Which would be inherent to governance models which run on top of this monetary model.
However, taxes are still useful because they can be used to discourage unsustainable behaviour such as pollution, destroying natural resources, … Money collected from taxes are also used to fund chosen projects for the common good, just like money collected from the demurrage fees.

#### 3.2.8 Taking money out of circulation
Continuously bringing new money into circulation would eventually lead to hyperinflation. Therefor there also needs to be a mechanism to take money out of circulation. This happens when a project for the common good is overfunded.

#### 3.2.9 Technical and psychological considerations
Technically money collected through taxes and demurrage fees could be taken out of circulation since money needed for projects for the common good can be brought into circulation as needed. For psychological reasons we have decided to not do this. We believe that giving people a chance to appoint that money to preferred projects would create a sense of ownership and involvement in society which would not happen when the money is simply taken out of circulation.
Publishing the funding numbers for each project on a continuous basis would probably also contribute to this as it would serve as a feedback system to the population.

## 4. Model simulation
A couple of simple stock and flow models of CMee have been created for a [single account][59] and the [total monetary mass][60] in the Cmee system. For comparison, a stock and flow model has also been created which simulates [a personal account with a guaranteed income in the current monetary system][61].
Every simulation is run with a guaranteed income of 2000, a cost free savings limit of 25000 and a demurrage fee 2%. The latter two only apply to CMee simulations.
For the personal accounts a monthly income of 100000 is used in order to model the hoarding incentive of the current system versus CMee. Expenses are set at 10000 per month with a variance of 1500. For the simulation of the current monetary system, an interest rate of 2% is used, something still easily attainable in the financial markets. 

![alt text](https://github.com/HapponomyOrg/CMee-Platform/blob/master/Sim%20-%20current%20system.png)

**Figure 3 - Account simulation in the current monetary system with 2% interest**

A personal account in the current monetary system with these parameters results in figure 3.
With the same parameters, in the proposed model, the graph becomes the one in figure 4.
As can be clearly observed, the hoarding incentive evaporates as soon as the balance curve flatlines.

A simulation of the total monetary mass, with spending on projects for the common good between 2000 and 7000 per citizen per month and taxes ranging between 0 and 10% per month (calculated on total monetary mass for simplicity), results in the graph of figure 5.
It is clear from this graph that the total monetary mass remains fairly stable over time.

**Figure 5 - Simulation of total monetary mass**
 
## 5. Determining parameters
There are several parameters which have an influence on the effects of implementing CMee. These are:

* The cost free savings limit
* The guaranteed income
* The number of tiers of the demurrage fee
* The demurrage fee percentages per tier

Instead of having these parameters being determined by a central authority we propose the determination is given into the hands of the population. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes in his book [Antifragile][62], adding a certain amount of chaos to a system actually makes the system better. Based on this we make the assumption that the system can become a learning system that adapts itself to the situation at hand.

Since the parameters must be able to change in order to adapt to a changing society and economy, we propose that everyone who has an account in CMee can vote for these parameters once a year. We want to avoid yearly shocks to the system, which could happen if everyone all at once would decide to double the guaranteed income for example. For that the changes need to be spread out. One easy way to achieve this spread would be to give everyone a window of a month, starting on their birthday, in which they can change their preferred parameters. The working parameters of CMee are then determined by the average of everyone’s votes.

There has to be a limit to how much the new parameters can deviate from the previous ones to avoid shocks to the system. If someone would set the guaranteed income at 1 trillion CC a month for example this would completely destroy the balance. To keep this in check we propose for example the following boundaries:

* Cost free savings limit: half current -> double current.
* Guaranteed income: half current -> double current.
* Number of demurrage fee tiers: -1 -> +1.
* Demurrage fee percentage per tier: -0.1% -> +0.1%

More research is needed to get a better understanding of the possible fluctuations that could be allowed.

It would be interesting to do research on what the initial set of parameters would be if we would allow the population to freely determine what they think they would have to be. And to simulate, through an agent based model, how that would play out in a working economy.

The phrasing would be of importance though. We would expect a different outcome if people would be asked ‘What would you like to get as a monthly guaranteed income’ vs ‘What do you think everyone should get as a monthly guaranteed income’.

## 6. Projects for the common good
As stated before, we believe that the decision of what a project for the common good is could be handled by the population. The process of how this would be handled is crucial though since a badly designed process could turn out to be disastrous.
One necessary component of this process is to open an informative communication channel between the experts and the population at large.

### 6.1 Power
An initial response by many could be that this would better be left over to a centralised entity but we argue against that. Centralisation of power has a tendency to lead to abuse of power. It could be argued that checks and controls could be put in place to counter this but then the question arises, who will enforce these checks and controls? As we can witness today that process often fails.
Decentralisation of power however has an inherently lower chance of being abused. And based on the research by Nassim Nicholas Taleb we believe it to be better that a lot of small things go wrong so the system as a whole can learn and get stronger than that we get black swan events with disastrous outcomes. Since determining which projects do and don’t get funding has an immediate effect on people’s lives we have a built in feedback system. This feedback system and the fact that projects can be started and stopped leave room for failure without that failure being necessarily dramatic.
The transition towards handing over full responsibility might have to be done in phases but we should research this before jumping to conclusions. People just might surprise us.

### 6.2 Budgeting
Contrary to the determination of which projects should get funded or not, we believe that budgeting of those projects should be left to their stakeholders. We believe that a collaborative process between them is possible and should lead to fair budgeting.

### 6.3 Transparency
The power to allot as much money to a project as needed also introduces a risk for corruption. In order to protect against that CMee offers complete transparency of these funds. To do that we earmark every coin that is brought into circulation for a project for the common good along with all the coins that are allocated to that project from demurrage and taxes. Every coin for education get an education tag for example. These coins can be tracked publicly until they have reached an organisation which has been approved to work on that type of project. This introduces some administration but it makes tracking down and rooting out corruption very easy and the administration can be considered lightweight.

## 7. Taxes
As with the projects for the common good we propose that what is to be taxed is also determined by the population. Finding a working process for this might even be more challenging than the one to determine the projects for the common good. Although the fact that people can choose where their taxes go to, combined with the certainty of a guaranteed income and a sense of control over the monetary system, might eradicate some or maybe even most of the resistance people have towards paying taxes.

## 8. Incentives
A monetary model that works this way has an effect on people’s behaviour through the incentives it creates.
Flowing money: the demurrage fee discourages extreme hoarding of capital. Because of this money keeps on flowing instead of getting ‘stuck’ in large capital hoards. This increases monetary velocity and thereby results in an economy which is less prone to a slowdown.
Interest free lending: it becomes interesting to lend out the capital that is subject to a demurrage fee in order to safeguard it against said demurrage fee and have it return interest free in smaller, periodic chunks. This allows people to invest in projects they believe in and payback can be guaranteed by the platform up to a point because there is always the guaranteed income flowing into the accounts of owners of the investment initiative. A well implemented platform can even automate lending under guaranteed conditions and with explicit permission of the custodian(s) of the account(s).

## 9. Desired and expected outcomes
The outcomes listed here are assumed, based on the incentives the model introduces and research that has been done into human behaviour.

Shift from thinking in capital to thinking in monetary streams: large, stationary capitals are not compatible with the proposed monetary system. Monetary streams on the other hand are a natural part of it. We assume this will eventually shift the thinking process from capital to monetary streams. That kind of thinking gives rise to a new way of looking at business models where money is in constant movement. When money constantly flows, the economy is constantly activated and economic crises could be a thing of the past.
Power shift: throughout history, those who controlled the creation of money also ended up with the greatest power according to the research in [Debt, the first 5000 years][1]. The system enables every individual to have a say in what money is brought into circulation for and thereby shifts power away from centralised institutions towards a decentralised participative model.
Direct action: the fact that the creation of monetary streams for projects for the common good is decided in a participatory way allows people to directly influence concrete action that has an effect on them and society at large.
Free time and mental bandwidth: The book [Scarcity][2] explains what scarcity does to people’s behaviour. This can be scarcity in money, time, social contact, … Concerns about scarcity gain the upper hand and result in short term thinking and tunnel vision. Most importantly, this eats away mental bandwidth, of which we all only have a limited amount each day. Scarcity in mental bandwidth leads to a hampered ability to reflect and assess true value in one’s life. A guaranteed income tackles the scarcity of money, something that often leads to scarcity in other areas as well. It takes people out of survival mode and frees up time and mental bandwidth for reflection. It shifts people from earning a living to having a life.
Increase in collaboration and sharing: [Adam Grant’s Give and Take][6] shows that people are more inclined to give than we would think. It’s just that we live in a society where, out of fear of not having enough money, [giving, sharing and helping are negatively influenced by the current monetary system][22]. Taking away the fear of not having enough money would work towards making people more collaborative and supportive towards each other. And there is scientific backing. Research has shown that [human nature is basically good][51].
Emergence of new, more sustainable business models: Short term capitalisation does not function well in CMee because the capital would have to be moved very quickly again in order to not lose it to the demurrage fee. Investments in long term, sustainable projects with a lower but regular return on investment become way more interesting. This stimulates sustainable long term investments, something which is highly needed but discouraged in our current monetary system because short term capitalisation can bring in much more profit.
From ownership to service: Ownership of goods usually requires money at the moment of purchase. The purchaser might borrow this money to make the purchase, thereby transforming outgoing money into an outgoing monetary stream. The seller on the other hand receives potentially large sums of money, which is not the ideal situation. The performance economy, a model created by Thomas Rau would fare way better and would create an incentive to produce long lasting, energy efficient, repairable and recyclable products.
Increasing job market flexibility: Since taxes on labour become obsolete (governance projects are no longer solely dependant on taxes to be fully funded), the entire administration surrounding it can be ditched. This opens the door to a vastly more flexible job market. People can now choose to have several part time jobs if they want to without going through all of the paperwork. Only the contracts between the employer and the employee remain, together with the legislation which makes them enforceable. An on demand job market can flourish without the administrative hassle. Restaurants, coffee bars and pubs could even ask their customers to jump in on busy hours.
A self learning, self steering society: CMee has several feedback loops built into it. The parameters are determined by the users of CMee so they can steer these parameters based on the effect that they have on their current lives. Projects for the common good can be started and stopped. Taxes can be installed and taken away. All these actions have a direct effect on people’s lives and are therefor feedback loops. If this is combined with well designed decision making processes to determine these things and with open and clear communication channels between citizens and experts we expect to get more involvement from citizens in running the society they live in.

## 10. Scalability
CMee is scalable. It can be implemented either in communities, on a local level in towns and cities up to countries and the entire world economy. The model even supports exchange rates between implementations if needed.
In order to exchange X A$ into B$ the following is done:
The exchange rate is determined based on the following formula:
* 1 B$ = ABase / BBase A$ where
* ABase = Savings limit A + guaranteed income A * 100 / demurrage fee A %
* BBase = Savings limit B + guaranteed income B * 100 / demurrage fee B %
* X A$ are destroyed.
* X * (ABase/BBase) B$ are created.

ABase and BBase are the balances on the personal accounts in the CC currencies where the demurrage fee becomes equal to the guaranteed income. This is dependant on the savings limit, the guaranteed income and the demurrage fee.
This has no profound effect on the total monetary mass since the demurrage fee will take care of excess money being created. Exchanges going the other way, from currency B to currency A, also help to cancel out inflationary effects.

## 11. Increasing sustainable consumption
The model can be extended to create an incentive for sustainable consumption. It would depend on the feasibility to implement a sustainability rating which is accepted across the entire user base of a CMee implementation however.
Imagine we have such a rating system and that the rating scale is 0 to 100, 0 being non sustainable, 100 being completely sustainable.

### 11.2 Rewarding sustainable spending
Since CMee is a digital monetary system, spending habits can be tracked (making sure privacy is protected) and therefore sustainable spending can be rewarded. This could be done through a bonus to the guaranteed income.
For that we calculate the average sustainability rating of someone’s spending over the period between 2 guaranteed income deposits. Based on that we give them a bonus of maximum 10% on their guaranteed income.
For example, if someone’s average rating over the period is 40, then they get 40% of the 10% bonus, being a 4% bonus on their guaranteed income.

## 12. Open for diversity
The currency model opens up room for diversity. Since governance is no longer dependent on taxes for budgeting, a more relaxed policy towards other currencies can be adapted. A plethora of local and/or special purpose currencies could be introduced alongside CMee in order to solve specific economic, social and environmental challenges. The only thing to watch out for is that these currencies are not used to avoid the taxes on ‘unwanted’ behaviour.

## 13. Introducing the system
The system aims to be a viable replacement for the current dominant currency system. Throwing the switch from one day to the other is not likely, so a transition period is needed in order for the switch to be executed in a nondestructive way.

### 13.1 Transitioning with governance support
Cooperation of governance would be the fastest way to implement a transition. As soon as governance accepts this system, starts paying jobs with Circular Money and eliminates taxes as a sole source for their income, everyone will automatically make the transition.
Governance support, although helpful, is not a necessity to make the transition though.

One transitioning method is described here but others might be implemented.

### 13.2 Incremental introduction 
Let's assume that we envision the following if people would be willing to commit for 100% in CMee:
Guaranteed income: 2000 CC/month
Start capital: 5000 CC
Savings limit: 25000 CC
Demurrage fee: 2%

#### 13.2.1 Setup
CMee can be introduced incrementally in the following way:
Give everyone a free personal account with 5% of the start capital, being 250 CC in this case.
This capital sits in the account until it is activated.

#### 13.2.2 Activation
Once people activate their accounts they sign in at a certain commitment level. The starting commitment level is 5%. The commitment level determines the maximum percentage of a price people are allowed to pay in CC and the minimum level they are required to accept in CC. The exact percentages that are used depend on the other party. Someone who has committed for 5% can only pay 5% of the price of a good regardless of how much the seller wants to accept. The other way around, a seller who commits for 5% will only need to accept 5% of the price in CC, regardless of the commitment level of the buyer.
Upon activation the following happens:

The activated account, including the commitment level becomes publicly visible in a ledger.
A guaranteed income equal to 5% of the target 100% guaranteed income, being 100 CC/month is gained.
A cost free savings limit of 5% of the 100% savings limit, being 1250 CC, is implemented.
The account holder can now use the available money to pay up to his commitment level, currently being 5%, of the price of services/goods purchased from others who accept it.
The account holder commits to accepting 5% of the price of his/her own offered services/goods in Circular Money and 95% in regular money. This ensures reciprocity and at the same time expands the available offer to be purchased with Circular Money.
The vote of the account holder to change the parameters of the system has the same weight as their commitment level.

The account is now activated and can be used freely with others in CMee. All active accounts are visible in CMee network, together with their commitment level.

#### 13.2.3 Increasing commitment
At any time the account holder can opt to increase his/her commitment to CMee by increasing the percentage that is being accepted for their products/services. Then the following happens:

Extra start capital is deposited on the account. This amount is a percentage of the 100% start capital. The percentage is equal to the new percentage - the old percentage of commitment.
The guaranteed income is raised to the new percentage.
The cost free savings limit is raised to the new percentage.
The percentage that can be spent, with people who are willing to accept that percentage, is raised to the new limit. 

For example, if someone decides to raise their commitment from 5% to 20%

Guaranteed income rises to 400 CC/month
Cost free savings limit is raised to 5000 CC
Start capital is raised with 750 CC (20% - 5% = 15% of 5000)

#### 13.2.4 Effects and conditions
Due to the built in transparency and reciprocity, abuse of the account (spending without willingness to receive) is excluded. The public ledger shows a list of available goods and services purchasable with Circular Money, including the maximum percentage of the price that can be paid with it.
In order to have a successful start it is important to assess which initial services/goods would be sufficient to entice people to participate in CMee. Being first is practically risk free since the people spending the currency will automatically accept an equal percentage.
It is also possible that people commit to CMee under certain conditions. Someone might say they are interested in participating in CMee but only if they can purchase food, beer and web services for example. That way they could commit without actually activating their account until these conditions are met. They could even have their initial commitment level be dependant on the commitment level of the providers of these goods/services.

#### 13.2.5 Introducing employees
One challenge is allowing employees to the system. If too many people who do not directly offer goods or services are introduced to CMee this may cause problems. One solution for this is to only allow goods and service providers to enter CMee on their own accord. Once they have committed to CMee their employees are also allowed to commit to it but only to the same level as their employers. This setup could introduce internal pressure from employees to get their employers to make a commitment, thereby enriching CMee.

## 14. Implementation
The currency is, due to its design, a digital currency. It should however not be implemented in a centralised fashion. In order for the model to fully work a distributed implementation is necessary. The dominating technology for that is currently the blockchain. There are however a couple of issues with this technology. Transaction speeds slow down when transaction volumes increase, a tremendous amount of processing power, and subsequently energy, is required to run its security algorithm and once a currency has been launched it can not be changed anymore. The first two issues stand in the way of scalability. The energy requirement opposes the sustainability goal of the model. The unchangeability creates a problem in the likely case when tweaks need to be done in order to optimise the model. For Ethereum this has resulted in 4 forks so far, something that is not desirable should the system run a world economy.
Therefore the technology requirements for a successful implementation of this model are defined as follows:

Lightweight: it should be able to run with a minimal of resources.
Performant: transaction speed needs to be fast. Confirmation of a transaction should be almost instantaneous, comparable to modern day traditional banking.
Distributed: it must run in a decentralised fashion.
Flexible: it needs to be adaptable for future needs. In order to achieve this in a way which is supported by its user base, a consensus model for decision making needs to be integrated. This consensus model must be efficient enough as to not cause unnecessary delays in updates while at the same time also prohibiting highjacking of the system by malignant parties. The open source community is probably a source of inspiration for this since they have vast experience with this type of challenge.
Easy to use: the client app must be simple and very easy to use.
Secure: the integrity of accounts must be validated. This only needs to be done when a transaction is executed since the state the account should be in can be calculated from the state it had during after the previous secure transaction.

A possible contender could be the framework proposed by [MetaCurrency](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae#.fnpakrjf9), [HashGraph](https://hackernoon.com/demystifying-hashgraph-benefits-and-challenges-d605e5c0cee5) or [HoloChain](https://medium.com/holochain/holochain-the-blockchain-picks-up-a-dimension-4dca43fe3a73). 

## 15. Accompanying governance models
The simple design of the proposed monetary system would, by itself, already create a tremendous shift in behaviour and societal structures. This comes at no cost apart from the implementation and running of the digital platform. Compared to the efforts required by governments to achieve these changes, it’s virtually free.
Yet, decisions still need to be made on which monetary streams to create for projects for the common good and what should be taxed. The crux here is to determine what can be considered as a ‘project for the common good’ and what is considered to be ‘behaviour damaging society and/or the environment’. There are some we can already put on the permanent ‘projects for the common good’ (education, health care, free public transport, environmental care) and the ‘damaging to society and/or environment’ (pollution, production of non repairable products, production of non recyclable products, ...)  lists but others would have to be decided on.
For that we have a couple of suggestions to be used as inspiration but these are up for discussion. The selection of these models and structures is strongly linked to, yet beyond the scope of this paper.

## 16. Moving forward
Apart from having to build the distributed platform on which CMee runs, the following factors would contribute to a successful adoption:

* Make sure the initial value offer is enticing enough for the community/city/country the model is implemented in.
* Collaborate with political reform groups and/or governance.
* Build support from academic research.
* Build simulation models to test out assumptions.
